        <h3>Who is Huda Kattan?</h3>
        <p> Huda Kattan is a social-media influencer who has built a beauty empire called ‘Huda Beauty’ with a whopping figure of $1.2 billion since 2019. She has grown remarkably fast since 2013, and has 26 million followers on Instagram. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>HudaBeauty</h3>
        <p> Huda saw a gap in the market as she could not find false eyelashes suitable enough for her clients.
            Huda then launched her brand in 2013 with her sisters Mona and Alya as they worked alongside each other to create false eyelashes which launched in Dubai. 
        Since then, Huda has had an enormous amount of growth both on Instagram as a social media blogger/influencer but also her beauty brand. 
        She has cultivated an extensive clientele including A-list celebrities. "I always knew I wanted to be global." Huda
    says in a recent interview with the BBC. 

    Huda has stated that she is not financially motivated in her overall aim but geninuely is on a mission 'to challenge the beauty industry' that
    she feels has boxed people in for a long time. HudaBeauty offers products that are inclusive for all skintones.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Huda's advice to being a successful entrepreneur:</h3>
<p> 1. You must believe passionately in your brand.
    <br>
    Start with these basic questions- "why do I want to start a business?" "Do I like the industry enough to be living and breathing it 24/7?"
    <br>
    <br>
    2. Surround yourself with a dedicated, loyal team and share your workload.
    <br>
    'To scale your business you need to delegate responsibilties to others and establish a strong company
    culture.'
    <br>
    <br>
    3. Be kind to other brands.
    <br>
    Support other brands on social media. Huda shares dupes of her products which always receives postive reactions
    from her followers and builds up the moral integrity of the brand.
