        <h3>Who is Cher Wang?</h3>
        <p>Cher Wang was born in one of the most wealthiest families in the world as she is the daughter of Wang Yung-Ching who founded Farmosa Plastics Group. 
            Cher is a founder of the company HTC along with one of her friends. 
            In 2000 HTC produced the Compaq Aero PDA and after this it became the official contract manufacturer of mobile phones and PDAs for brands such as Orange, T-Mobile and O2. 
            Cher Wang has crafted her company into a business that manufactures and produces Android smart phones but also tablets and has made quite a name for itself. Cher Wang has undoubtedly shown the power of being ‘Quietly Brilliant’ and is very inspirational to young women who wish to become an successful entrepreneur.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>What challenges did she overcome?</h3>
        <p>In 2006, her business, HTC, had a low stock value and was struggling for a few years. HTC was unable to invest into more capital for building and designing smartphones. However, HTC soon became the largest selling brand of smartphones at Sprint, T-Mobile. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Advice for young women:</h3>
        <p> <em>Be honest about your talent and open to change-</em>
            <br>
           Cher has said in a recent interview with Refinery 29, that although we have been told from a young
           age to 'follow our passion' however this may not be the best route to success all the time. She recalled 
           how when she was younger she always wanted to be a piano player but realised that her passion may not be
           enough to do well in. She then decided to focus on an economics degree. 
           <br>
           <br>
           <em>Get financial sense- </em>
           <br>
           Cher points out that you should make spending decisions approriately such as doing so in a way that
           your future self will thank you for e.g. taking a class to learn/advance a new skill.
           As a result Cher does not spend her money on fancy private jets and rather invests her savings by
           using taxis and commericial planes.
            <br>
            <br>
           <em>Recognise your power as a consumer- </em>
           <br>
           Wang has mentioned that it is important for an aspiring entrepreneur to target their products 
           at reaching the interests of women as women have a 'strong purchasing power'. For instance, Wang
           used this principle to create gadgets that women will find useful and not forget about.
