        <h3>What challenges did she face?</h3>
        <p>After she graduated from Oxford, she moved her team to an office 
            and has said that she often felt that she should show up 
        with a suit to play the part. Grace has also spoke about dealing with imposter
    syndrome whilst she went through this change.

            Grace has also spoken up about the prejudice that is assoicated with being an social
            media influencer. She said that in external meetings it can be quite obvious that the people
            in the meetings have a prejudged opinion about her and may assume that she is just the 'face' of 
            the brand rather than the owner. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>How did she overcome these obstacles?</h3>
        <p>Grace has stopped worrying about how she is perceived in a meeting.
            She has said "let them have their preconceptions about me, I'm just going to get on 
            with my job". Grace has also let go of the notion that to be seen seriously and professionally,
            you have to wear suits.
