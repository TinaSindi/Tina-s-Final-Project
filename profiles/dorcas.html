        <h3>Who is Dorcas Muthoni?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Dorcas Muthoni is the founder and Chief Exceutive Officer of Openworld Ltd
            which is a specialist computer software company in Kenya. She founded this company when
            she was just 24 years old! Her startup story includes starting in university with only 5
            other women engineers to build networks.
        </p>
<br>
        <h3>Obstacles she overcame</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Dorcas mentioned in a interview with Reuters that she found she had to prove herself
            in her early years. She was met with skepticism that she could be successful in IT as a woman.
        A comment that she recalled was "Are you sure this is going to work out? I mean why don't you do
        something else, like leasing event furniture?" She also had to convince people that her 
    home-grown brand could be as good as big brand like Microsoft which was difficult to do. </p>
<br>
        <h3>Her impact:</h3>
        <br>
        <p>In 2004, Dorcas founded an organisation called AfChix which 
            has the primary aim of building initiative for women in the region. She has also
            started a mentorship programme in high schools and involves bringing girls from different
            schools together and empowering them with access to ask questions to female web developers, engineers 
            and build mentor-mentee relationships.
