        <h3>Who is Reshma Saujani? </h3>
        <p>Reshma is the Founder and CEO of Girls Who Code. 
            She is also the author of 'Brave, Not Perfect'
        which is an international bestseller! She previously worked in
        the financial services industry which she did not like. She has starred in a TED
    Talk called 'Teach Girls, bravery not perfection' which has more than 4 million views worldwide! </p>
        <br>

        <h3>What does Girls Who Code inspire to achieve?</h3>
        <p>Girls Who Code is an international nonprofit organisation with the sole 
            aim of teaching young girls coding and computer programming skills. 
            300,000 young women have been introduced to coding 
            because of this organisation aiming to help bridge the gender gap
            in the technology industry. Reshma was made more aware to the gap for women
            as she visted schools during her run to become a US congress and saw that
            there were lots of boys saying they would like to be the next Mark Zuckerberg but no girls.
            <br>
            <br>
            Girls Who Code has a whole range of opportunities for young women to grasp. They offer 2 week summer
            programs for 10-12th grade girls to learn coding. There are also after-school clubs and college programs
            and currently a summer virtual experience. These oppoortunities have led to many young women 
            learn skills that could eventually lead to their job or major in college. 
            
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>What advice does she have for women?</h3>
        <p>1. To stop chasing perfection in an attempt to be brave.
            "So many women stick to doing only the things at which they excel,
            rarely going beyond what makes them feel confident and comfortable"
            <br>
            2. Learn to say no.
            Reshma has stated that women always try and adjust rather than say no to things.
            <br>
            3. Get out of your comfort zone.
            Reshma has said that many men do not things perfectly and they do not feel guilty about things
            like how women do. They accept that they cannot be perfect at everything which Reshma
            refers to as 'bravery' to stay off the path of perfectionism.
